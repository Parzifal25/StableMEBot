    "question": "What is PCOS?",
    "answer": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal condition where ovaries produce higher-than-normal levels of androgens and ovulation may be irregular. It often causes menstrual irregularities, acne, hair growth, and metabolic changes. PCOS affects reproductive and metabolic health and can increase the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes. Early diagnosis helps manage symptoms and reduce long-term risks."
  },
  {
    "topic": ["PCOD", "PCOS"],
    "question": "What is the difference between PCOD and PCOS?",
    "answer": "The terms are often used interchangeably but PCOS is the widely accepted medical term describing a syndrome of hormonal imbalance. PCOD is a colloquial term sometimes used regionally to describe ovarian dysfunction with similar features. Clinically focus is on symptoms, metabolic risk and ovulatory function rather than the label. Management principles remain the same: lifestyle, metabolic screening, and targeted treatment."
  },
  {
    "topic": ["PCOD", "PCOS", "Symptoms"],
    "question": "What are the common symptoms of PCOS?",
    "answer": "Common symptoms include irregular or absent periods, difficulty getting pregnant, acne, excess facial or body hair, and thinning scalp hair. Many people also experience weight gain, fatigue, and darkened skin patches (acanthosis nigricans). Symptoms vary in severity and may begin in the late teens or early 20s. If you notice these signs, discuss them with a clinician for evaluation."
  },
  {
    "topic": ["PCOD", "PCOS", "Causes"],
    "question": "What causes PCOS?",
    "answer": "PCOS has no single known cause but involves a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Insulin resistance and elevated insulin levels can increase androgen production and disrupt ovulation. Low-grade inflammation and hormonal signaling differences contribute as well. Family history of PCOS or type 2 diabetes raises risk."
  },
  {
    "topic": ["PCOD", "PCOS", "Diagnosis"],
    "question": "How is PCOS diagnosed?",
    "answer": "Diagnosis is clinical and usually requires two of three features: irregular ovulation, excess androgen signs (clinical or biochemical), and polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound. Doctors also exclude other causes such as thyroid disease, prolactinoma, or adrenal disorders. Blood tests for hormone levels and metabolic screening are common. A comprehensive history and physical exam guide further testing."
  },
  {
    "topic": ["PCOD", "PCOS", "Diagnosis", "Teens"],
    "question": "Can teenagers be diagnosed with PCOS?",
    "answer": "Teen diagnosis is possible but must be cautious because irregular cycles and acne can be normal in puberty. Clinicians usually wait until menstrual cycles have been irregular for at least two years post-menarche or until age 16 unless symptoms are severe. Evaluation includes history, exam, and selective blood tests. Avoid premature labeling and focus on symptom management and monitoring."
  },
  {
    "topic": ["PCOD", "PCOS", "Menstrual Health"],
    "question": "Why are my periods irregular with PCOS?",
    "answer": "Irregular periods occur because ovulation is infrequent or absent when hormonal signals are disrupted. High androgens and insulin resistance can prevent regular egg release and thinning of the uterine lining. Cycle length may become unpredictable and some people miss periods entirely. Regulating cycles uses weight management, hormonal contraception, or other ovulation-supporting treatments."
  },
  {
    "topic": ["PCOD", "PCOS", "Fertility"],
    "question": "Does PCOS cause infertility?",
    "answer": "PCOS is a common cause of ovulatory infertility because irregular ovulation makes conception harder. Many people with PCOS can conceive with lifestyle measures, ovulation induction medications, or assisted reproductive techniques. Addressing weight, insulin resistance, and timely medical treatment improves pregnancy chances. Fertility specialists provide personalized pathways when first-line measures fail."
  },
  {
